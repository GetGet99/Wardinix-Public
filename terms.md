# Terms and Conditions

For Wardinix version 0.0.4

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Wardinix ("the Application"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Application. For the purposes of these Terms, a "User" refers to an individual or an organization that interacts with the Application. By downloading and using the Application, the User agrees to these Terms and Conditions. If the User does not agree with any part of these Terms, they must not download or use the Application.

## 2. Liability and Warranty

- **The Application is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied**, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.
- **The developer is not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Application, <ins>whether the User has paid for it or not</ins>**. This includes, but is not limited to, any damages or loss of data resulting from the use of the Application or the inability to use it.
- **In no event shall the developer or any contributors to the Application be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Application or the use of the Application.**

## 3. Payment and Features

- Payment does not unlock additional features. The Application is fully functional regardless of payment status.
- Payment only removes the unpaid badge, but usage rights may be restricted based on payment status (see Software Usage Rights section below).

## 4. Acknowledgments Before Payment

Before making a payment, the User acknowledges the following:

1. **The User has downloaded and securely stored a copy of the installer of the version of the Application that the User decided to pay for from the GitHub Releases. If the installer of the version of the Application the User wishes to pay for is not available on the GitHub Releases, the user should not proceed with payment**, as the current version of the Application may not be available for reinstallation. While we try to keep Releases available, there is no guarantee they will remain accessible indefinitely.
2. **All payments are final. By paying, the User confirms that they have tested the Application and are satisfied with its functionality.**
3. **Payment does not unlock additional features**, as stated in Section 3.
4. Payment applies only to the current version of the Application. Future updates are not guaranteed, and we reserve the right to charge for upgrades. If an automatic update occurs and the User is dissatisfied, they may revert to a previously downloaded version.
5. We reserve the right to change the price of the Application or make it available free of charge at any time.
6. If the User has paid but the Application still shows an unpaid badge, they can manually dismiss it using the "Wait! I already paid." button. However, Software Usage Rights still apply based on actual payment status, not on whether the badge is displayed.
7. If the User receives a refund, their license is considered revoked. They may only continue using the Application for testing purposes unless they repurchase it.

## 5. Software Usage Rights

1. The User has the right to use the Application for commercial or personal purposes for 30 days from agreeing to these Terms.
2. After 30 days, unpaid Users may only use the Application for testing purposes. Commercial and personal use is not allowed before payment.
3. Organizations must make a payment for each individual within the organization who uses the Application. If an individual stops using the Application (e.g., due to leaving the organization), another individual may take their place, as long as the total number of individuals using the Application does not exceed the number of payments made by the organization.
4. If a refund is issued by Microsoft or any payment provider, the User will be considered as not having a valid license, unless they make a new payment. All rights to use the Application for commercial or personal purposes are revoked, and usage is restricted to testing purposes only as described above.

## 6. Clarifications

- The free trial in the Application is an approximation of the policy above and does not override the Software Usage Rights policy.
- If a User reinstalls the Application or resets trial data, they are still bound by the original Software Usage Rights terms.

## 7. Reverse Engineering and Modification

- The User may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to discover the source code of the Application by any means, unless expressly permitted by applicable law.
- The User may not modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Application, including but not limited to adding malware or altering its functionality.
- The User may not distribute, share, or otherwise make available the decompiled or modified source code of the Application, whether for personal or commercial purposes.

## 8. Updates to the Terms and Conditions

The Terms and Conditions may change at any time. However, this Terms and Conditions is linked with the version number specified above. If you update the application, we may have a newer version of Terms and Conditions for associated version.
